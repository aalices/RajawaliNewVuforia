# RajawaliNewVuforia

Attempt to integrate RajawaliVuforia library with Vuforia v. 5+
Based on: https://github.com/Rajawali/RajawaliVuforia

Any native changes need compiling with NDK. After that use: 
```
gradlew(.bat) clean assembleRelease uploadArchives
```
the lib will be available in local repo.
